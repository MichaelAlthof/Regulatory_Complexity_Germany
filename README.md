# Regulatory Complexity Germany

This repository contains the quantlets corresponding to the master thesis "Measuring Regulatory Complexity and its Impact on the German Banking Sector".

### Abstract
Just recently, the unmasking of the cum-ex scandal started the debate about regulatory complexity in the German banking sector again. The German government lost about EUR 30 billion due to a loophole banks discovered in the German income tax law. However, do only large banks exploit such loopholes in regulations and does complexity influence other investment behaviours? This thesis applies machine learning techniques to the German Banking Act and constructs a measure of regulatory complexity.  By means of a panel regression on bank statement data over the years 2012-2016, I find evidence that even though regulatory complexity reduces bank's returns in general, it is indeed mostly exploited by larger banks who are able to make a profit. However, the data does not show an impact of regulatory complexity on banks' lending behaviour.
